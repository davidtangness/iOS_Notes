These are my notes from the official iOS tutorial “Start Developing iOS Apps Today”, which walks through the creation of a ToDoList app.

Initial setup, you need Xcode and the IOS SDK.

Xcode gives you the option of writing in either objective-c or swift. Swift is very new, so it might be best for me tolerant the more-established objective-c first.

Objective-c is an object oriented language based on C, with the usual ideas of classes, inheritance and so forth but a rather different syntax than Java/C++. 


For this tutorial we’ll start with a “Single-View Application” template and name it ToDoList.

The template code can be build and run immediately in XCode’s iOS simulator. Running it will give us a white screen with the name “ToDoList” in the middle, which switches to a blank white screen after a few seconds. 

So what code is making this happen? We'll start in the "main" function of the file "main.m", which can be found in the project's Suporting Files folder.

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
@autoreleasepool {
    return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([AppDelegate class]));
    }
}
